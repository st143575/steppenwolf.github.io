## What problems does this paper address?
{% asset_img figure_2.png %}

Fine-grained critique and correction of LVLMs for self-improvement in visual perception and reasoning tasks with CoT.

## What's the motivation of this paper?
- Even with Chain-of-Thought (CoT), LVLMs remain prone to hallucination and reasoning errors, raising concern about the trustworthiness of LVLMs and highlights the need for more reliable visual reasoning abilities.
- It lacks a systematic analysis of the critique and correction capabilities of LVLMs for self-improvement.
- Existing work typically use a single scalar to critique the entire model response.

## How does this paper address these issues?


## What are the main contributions of this paper?
1. This paper releases **VISCO**, the first benchmark to extensively analyze fine-grained critique and correction capabilities of LVLMs.
2. This paper proposes the **LookBack** strategy to enhance the critique capability of LVLMs and benefit their correction performance.
3. This work serves as an initial exploration into self-improvement of visual reasoning.
